Execute the file in "scatter_plot.py"

Clicking the single points will add them to the results and change the color of the clicked points.

!!!
Clicking OUTSIDE the triangle will not register as measurment (but will change color)
!!!

The standard values are 2x2 plots (for ease of use) with 10 measurments. 

Change the Variables in scatter_plot.py for the desired outcome
nrows = number of plots in the rows
ncols = number of plots in columns
n_of_measurments = number of desiderd measurments
ellabels = Element labels for the 4 verticies
compsint = Data to be plotted (Rigth now, just a uniformly scattered Data)

The Program will close after reaching the desired number of measruments and save the data in a .csv file
